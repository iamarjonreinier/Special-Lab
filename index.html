      Hi Ma'am Roan,<br><br>
      As the holiday season approaches, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for all the hard work and dedication you put into teaching us this year. Your guidance, encouragement, and support have made a world of difference, and I’m truly thankful for everything you do.

Wishing you a Merry Christmas filled with peace, joy, and time spent with loved ones. May the new year bring you happiness and continued success.

Thank you again for being such an inspiring teacher Ma'am Roan!

 Have a blessed Christmas!
